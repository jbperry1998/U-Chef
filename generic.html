								<h2>Delivery Service</h2>
								<h3>One of the biggest barriers for students trying to get into the habbit 
									of cooking healthy meals for themselves is taking the time to go to the 
									grocery store. To combat this we are starting a grocery delivery service.
									Every week there will be recipes posted online with instructional videos that
									you can sign up to get delivered right to you door.

								<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat a splash of olive oil in a small skillet and cook vegetables until soft, then add garlic and reduce heat to low, cooking for an additional 5 min.</p>
								<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut chicken into pieces about 1 inch by Â½ inch, then salt and pepper both sides</p>
								<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat another splash of olive oil in a skillet. Add the chicken when the water spits in the oil. Make sure to spread out the chicken to get even contact. Cook about 2 minutes on the first side, flipping when an even light brown color is formed. Cook an additional 1 minute on the second side.</p>
								<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After the vegetables, chicken and rice are all cooked, combine in one pan with olive oil over medium high heat. Crack the two eggs over top once the pan is hot, stirring to combine.</p>
								<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Cook until the eggs are cooked through, adding any additional flavors like soy sauce or hot sauce as you feel</p>

									<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
									<h3>There are lots of small things that go into cooking your own meals that
										aren't common knowledge. We are here to give you the little tips that make
										 all the difference.
									</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Never Freeze Meat twice: if you freeze, thaw and refreeze meat, the water inside the cels of the meat will start to fall aprat and all the texture will be gone</li>
										<li>Heat is flavor: always heat your cooking serface before starting to cook, especially for meat. If you don't hear a sizzle, get it back out of the pan and wait for heat.</li>
										<li>Don't rinse oil: pouring excess oil down the drain can cause expensive longterm problems with plumbing. For any fats or oils, pour the extra into a metal or glass container to throw away.</li>
										<li>Don't leave surface area when you freeze: freezing raw meat can be a great way to keep food available for longer and avoid frequent trips to the store. But if you dont wrap it tightly, you may start to accumulate freezer burn.</li>
										<li>Everything is better with garlic and butter: don't believe me? Next time your'e cooking dinner, try adding minced garlic and a nob of butter to finish off your protien. I gaurentee it will only improve the flavor.</li>
